Corona Virus Project for Programming II

Dear Mr. Deepak,

I hope everything works well, I am new to github and it got me a little bit confused so I hope everything works as it should.
Here is my whole Corona-Management Project, also with my progress and struggles, I just added everything in so 
you can see how I progressed and my way of thinking. 

Just to let you know, I added Erik as a collaborator too just to test if he can access it so there are no problems when submitting.

Thank you and have a nice day,

Å imon Ugor
